# Algorithmic Design and Analysis Stanford Course

## Problem 1
Merge sort, whilst counting the number of inversions used to sort the array. 

## Problem 2
Quicksort, implementations for both in place and copying versions.

## Problem 3
Karger's algorithm for solving the problem of the minimum cut on an undirected graph.

## Problem 4
Kosaraju's algorithm for finding the strongly connected components (SCCs) in a directed graph, makes use of the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm.

## Problem 5
Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest paths to all nodes given a source node on a graph. Implemented using a Binary Heap (priority queue) data structure.

## Problem 6
1. Median maintenance problem for streaming data, implemented with two Binary Heap (priority queue) data strutures.
2. Two-sum problem using python's built in set data structure.

## Problem 7
1. Job scheduling problem, solved using a greedy algorithm.
2. Prim's algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree (MST) implemented using a Binary Heap (priority queue) data structure.

## Problem 8
Implemented a UnionFind data structure with union by rank and path compression to solve:
1. Max k spacing clustering algorithm.
2. Number of clusters with minimum spacing of 3 on large graph with edge weights defined by hamming distance.

## Problem 9
Dynamic programming solution to the knapsack problem. Two implementations, one that stores the whole table and one that only returns the maximum value but uses less memory.

## Problem 10
Floyd-Warshall algorithm for finding all shortest paths on a directed graph.

## Problem 11
Dynamic programming solution to the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)

## Problem 12
Papadimitriou's local search algorithm for the 2-SAT problem.
